### STEPS

*Describe what you did which caused the problem you saw. The more specific you can be, the more likely I will be able
to figure out what the problem is.  Pretend like I don't actually know how Done Habit works.*

  1. Go to donehabit.com/busted-page
  2. Click on the "Break Me" button
  3. Type "BOOM!!!" into the top text field on the page.

### EXPECTED

*Describe what you were expecting to happen. If necessary, be specific as to which step you were expecting which thing
to happen.*

On step 3, I thought I should see a small bomb appear on the screen next to the text field after I pressed enter.

### ACTUAL

*Describe what really happened.  If multiple things went wrong, describe each one, which step it happened on, and, if
appropriate, what you did to try to work around it.*

Instead of a bomb, a window popped up and played funny cat videos.
